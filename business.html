                    app, adding gamifying aspects and adding a referral system.<br>

                <h4 class="text-center">Key Resources</h4>
                <p>The key resources needed are cloud services, active users and capable employees. Cloud services such
                    as Google's Firebase Cloud Firestore, Microsoft Azure, or Amazon Web Services. The listings the
                    users create are also an important resource, the whole service relies on user-provided data to
                    function. If partnerships with companies are created to add the ability to rent out tools (as
                    opposed to borrowing), they will also be considered key resources.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Key Partners</h4>
                <p>Our key partners are mainly the users themselves. The supply being the items they are willing to loan
                    out. Another key partner is a cloud provider such as Amazon with their Amazon Web Services or
                    Microsoft Azure. This partner provides the ability to create a web service so that users can share
                    their needs through an app. Enforcing companies that can enforce penalties for stealing or not
                    returning an item on time. This system is also interesting for landlords, as the app could be used
                    to divide building resources. Renting companies could be a good option to get a larger initial
                    supply for the service. Investors.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Cost Structure</h4>
                <p> The business structure class is value-driven, as the business model focuses on creating value for a
                    service. The fixed costs will be the salary of the employees. The variable costs would be the cost
                    of renting the servers as that would scale with the number of users and the money that is invested
                    as advertisement. </p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4 class="text-center">Revenue Streams</h4>
                <p>There are several revenue streams, some of them already implemented and some that might be
                    implemented in the future. One that is already in the app now is the penalties for delayed return.
                    If a user returns an item after the agreed upon date, the user will have to pay a fine. Kitley takes
                    a portion of this fine. This revenue stream is similar to how Blockbuster used to work. The pinging
                    system is another one. When users first download the app they get a free ping, but after that they
                    will have to pay to use the pinging system again. This money goes straight to us. A possible future
                    revenue stream could come from advertising certain items or services, by putting them near the top
                    of the nearby offers list.</p>

                <p>Kitley aims at acquiring initial customers by both physical and online marketing, for this we refer
                    to the marketing plan section. Then we aim at growing the customer base through word of mouth and a
                    referral system that rewards successful referrals with free pings. For communication with customers
                    a chatbot will be used where possible, otherwise customer service via chat. Since it is a community
                    driven platform, Kitley is very open to suggestions from the public about how to improve in the
                    future. We aim to keep a very open and active communication going with our users.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Channels</h4>
                <p>The main channel is ofcourse the smartphone app. Later it could be complemented by a web-based
                    interface. We are also keeping an eye on new devices that are becoming more popular in recent times
                    such as smartwatches.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Customer Segments</h4>
                <p>Mass Market: We are aiming at users of all age groups, genders and walks of life, everyone could need
                    a tool they donâ€™t have or be willing to lend one out. Of course we mainly focus on strong
                    communities, situated in more or less densely populated areas. An example would be a college campus
                    at the beginning of the year. There is a big need for tools to set everyone up in their new
                    accommodation, people are looking to build a community and generally live close to each other. That
                    is why for the initial launch we will focus on students and young adults.</p>
