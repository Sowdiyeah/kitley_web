				<p> Creating and maintaining the Kitley app: a service, where people looking to borrow household tools and other items can find people who are willing to lend them one and vice versa.
				Features include:
				The ability to search for items that you want to loan. The ability for the service to notify other users is also crucial for success. Furthermore, being able to create groups and finding other groups is central to the success of the service.
				Providing a user friendly interface.

			<div class="col-md-4 features">
				<center>
				<h4>Key Resources</h4></center><br>
				<p> The key resources needed are cloud services and active users.
				The listings the users create are also an important resource, the whole service relies on user-provided data to function. Also the employees of our company, of course.

			<div class="col-md-4 features">
				
				
				<center><h4>Partner Network</h4></center><br>
		
				<p> Our key partners are mainly the users themselves. The supply the items they are willing to loan out.
				Another key partner is a cloud provider such as Amazon with their Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. This partner provides the ability to create a web service so that users can share their needs through an app.
				Enforcing companies that can enforce penalties for stealing or not returning and item on time.
				This system is also interesting for landlords, as the app could be used to divide building resources.
				Renting companies could be a good option to get a larger initial supply for the service.
				Investors.
