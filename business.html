                <p>Creating and maintaining the Kitley app: a service, where people looking to borrow household tools
                    and other items can find people who are willing to lend them one and vice versa.<br><br>
                    Features include:
                <ul>
                    <li>The ability to search for items that you want to loan. </li>
                    <li>The ability for the service to notify other
                        users.</li>
                    <li>The ability to create groups and finding other groups.</li>
                    <li>Providing a user friendly interface.</li>
                    <li>Internet marketing.</li>

                <h4 class="text-center">Key Resources</h4>
                <p>The key resources needed are cloud services and active users. Cloud services such as Google's
                    Firebase Cloud Firestore, Microsoft Azure, or Amazon Web Services. The listings the users create are
                    also an important
                    resource, the whole service relies on user-provided data to function. If partnerships with companies
                    are created to add the ability rent out tools (as opposed to borrowing), they will also be
                    considered key resources.</p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h4 class="text-center">Key Partners</h4>
                <p>Our key partners are mainly the users themselves. The supply the items they are willing to loan out.
                    Another key partner is a cloud provider such as Amazon with their Amazon Web Services or Microsoft
                    Azure. This partner provides the ability to create a web service so that users can share their needs
                    through an app. Enforcing companies that can enforce penalties for stealing or not returning and
                    item on time. This system is also interesting for landlords, as the app could be used to divide
                    building resources. Renting companies could be a good option to get a larger initial supply for the
                    service. Investors.</p>

                <p><b>Convenience</b>, when a user needs a particular item, think of a hammer, just after he has moved

                <h4 class="text-center">Cost Structure</h4>
                <p> The business structure class is value-driven, as the business model focuses on creating value for a
                    service. The fixed costs will be the salary of the employees. The variable costs would be the cost
                    of renting the servers as that would scale with the number of users and the money that is invested
                    as advertisement. </p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Revenue Streams</h4>
                <p> Possible revenue streams are: Penalties for delayed returns. Take a cut from renting expensive
                    items, e.g. laptops. Advertising items or services to lend, for example putting listings at the top
                    of the nearby offers list. Pinging system. When you need an item (quickly), you can ping people in
                    your area to ask if they can lend you this item. Pings cost a certain amount of money that goes
                    straight to us. When you respond to a ping, you get in-app currency, or the equivalent of ½ or ⅓ of
                    a ping yourself. When you first sign up you get a certain amount of free pings. Referring someone
                    will earn you pings as well. </p>

                    New device that are becoming more popular in recent times such as smartwatches are also considered

                    in. To get the app launched, it is smart for the service to focus on people living in highly dense
                    areas, preferably students and young adults.</p>
