                <h4 class="text-center">Find items</h4>
                <p>Find exactly the item that you need by looking through the available items in your area using a
                    strong search feature and filters, that allow you to specify what you want and under which
                    conditions. Select the item and immediately get into contact with the person lending it out.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">List items</h4>
                <p>Kitley allows you to very easily put the items online that you want to let the people in your
                    neighbourhood borrow from you, so they can have quick access to it when they need it. Perfect if you
                    want to help out and strengthen your community!</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Ping</h4>
                <p>Are you in a hurry and the item you need is not listed? Use a ping to notify people in your area and
                    ask if any of them can help you out. Receiving these pings is also beneficial to you, because if you
                    respond to a ping, you get in-app currency, which you can use towards buying pings yourself.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Inventory</h4>
                <p>Kitley offers a clear overview of what item you are currently lending out, to whom you are lending
                    it to, and when you expect it to be returned. Similarly, Kitley also keeps track of what you are
                    borrowing. This removes a lot of stress and uncertainty from the whole process.</p>
