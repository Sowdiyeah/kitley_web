				<p>A rabbit-analysis is an analysis where we take a look at how an industry changed or is currently
					changing due to a technological disruption or a change in the technological landscape. The analogy
					comes from how disrupted the ecosystem in Australia during the 18th century (reference Stop! Nobody
					move!) </p>

				<p>First of all it is important that we clearly define what our “Australia” is. What is the industry
					that is being changed by digitalization and further development in technology? We are taking a look
					at the process of borrowing and lending out items, specifically to people in the neighbourhood. </p>

				<p>Borrowing household items between neighbours has a long history, as it is very useful for items and
					tools that one does not use often. Before the digital era if one wanted to request something from
					their neighbours they had to physically go knock on their door and ask. This could’ve been good or
					bad depending on the relationship with your neighbours, but one thing is for certain: it limited the
					number of people you could easily reach if you were in need of something. This may not have been a
					problem if the tool you’re looking for was a common household item, but if it was more rare you may
					have needed to spend a lot of time and effort to get the thing you need, if you could even get it at
					all. </p>
				<center> <img src="img/rabbit/knock.jpg" width=650 height=450> </center>
				<p>In the last decade, with the arrival of social media, a lot of social interactions have moved to the
					digital space. It was not different for the process of borrowing and lending out items. With the
					existence of WhatsApp group chats, facebook groups, etc, it had become quite easy to reach a lot
					more people at once for something if you were in need. For example, you were in a WhatsApp group
					with the other people on your apartment floor and you needed a hammer, so you put a message in the
					group chat asking if anyone had a hammer you could borrow. Although this was a bit more convenient,
					a lot of things could still be improved. </p>
				<center> <img src="img/rabbit/whatsapp.jpg" width=650 height=450> </center>
				<p>First of all, we would like to limit the amount of notifications one receives. While being in all
					those chat groups can be handy, it very quickly turns into a massive wave of spam notifications.
					Apart from the sheer volume of these notifications, the structure is also a problem. There is no
					filtering. If you are part of the group, you get a notification for every single message. But maybe
					you are not interested or you do not have time to follow a chat of people joking around and only
					want to receive notifications that are important to you. All these problems can in some cases even
					lead to leaving the groups or turning off the notifications altogether. When that happens, these
					groups lose all their utility. There is no “in between” for receiving notifications. </p>
				<p>It can also be hard to find all of these groups in the first place. If you just arrived in a new
					apartment, where do you find the chat group for your building or floor, if there even is one?
					Sometimes you can go for weeks or months without even knowing that one of these chats or groups
					exist. </p>
				<p>Another problem more specifically related to borrowing and lending through these apps is that there
					is no overview for the process. Someone asks for something, maybe a couple messages later someone
					responds, the item gets exchanged, a ton of other messages appear in the chat, by the time the item
					needs to be returned it’s hard to find the original conversation. It is chaotic to keep track of
					borrowed and lent out items, when the transactions took place and when the items should be returned,
					and which people are involved. </p>
				<p>Trust is another issue. Are you willing to lend out items to someone you have never met, that happens
					to live in the same building as you, if there is no security net in place? Maybe something that has
					no value, however if we are talking about a more expensive item you might think twice. It is very
					hard to keep people accountable through the chats alone or set a hard deadline as to when the item
					should be returned. </p>
				<p>And to top if all off, convenience. Going through all sorts of dispersed channels asking in chat form
					for an item can be annoying and time consuming. It would be nice to streamline this process on a
					centralized platform. </p>
				<p>Our service aims to resolve all these problems, and more.</p>

				<p>So, how does our service in the form of an app go about solving all the problems in the previous
					section? We will go over them one by one, and explain exactly what we have come up with.</p>
				<p>With Kitley we aim at reducing notifications in two ways: We streamlined the whole process of
					borrowing and lending so that less communication is needed in general, and we implemented a system
					that limits notifications to the ones that are necessary and helpful to you personally. The way we
					streamlined the process is by allowing users to list items they are willing to lend out, and when a
					user wants to borrowing something, all she has to do is search for an item and choose a maximum
					distance she has to go to pick it up, and choose the item from the list that appears. The other user
					receives a notification that someone wants to borrow their item and a private chat opens up where
					they can make arrangements. One notification, no spam. Of course this process is limited, what if I
					want to borrow something that is not listed, or if it is something I need urgently and do not have
					the time to go far to pick it up. For that, we implemented a pinging system. When you need an item
					quickly, you can ping people in your area to ask if they can lend you this item. Pings cost a
					certain amount of money so they will not be spammed. Receiving these pings is beneficial to you,
					because if you respond to a ping, you get in-app currency, which you can use towards buying pings
					yourself. This whole process limits notifications to situations where it is absolutely necessary or
					when it can benefit both users.</p>
				<p>Kitley also circumvents the problem of having to find and be a part of a whole slew of different
					groups and group chats. All you have to do is download Kitley and you can immediately start </p>
				<p>Kitley offers a clear overview of what items you are currently lending out, to whom you are lending
					it to, and when you expect it to be returned. Similarly, it also keeps track of what you are
					borrowing. This removes a lot of stress and uncertainty from the whole process. </p>
				<p> When it comes to trust, Kitley aims at improving this aspect implicitly by setting clear boundaries
					for how long an item can be borrowed and by use of a rating system that can show other users how
					trustworthy a certain user is, and explicitly by requiring a user to register and charging late fees
					if an item is not returned on time. Kitley will partner with enforcing companies that will ensure
					that breaking the rules will have consequences. This will be easier in certain countries compared to
					others, for example in Sweden we could ask for personal numbers for identification, while in other
					countries some other methods need to be employed. Of course measures have to be taken to prevent
					people from signing up with a personal number that is not theirs. </p>
				<p> Lastly, convenience. Kitley streamlines the whole process of borrowing and lending, it removes the
					need for tons of different group chats, everything is centralized on one app. When you want to
					borrow an item, you do not have to ask for it in multiple channels and hope you get a response, you
					can open the app and look through what is available in your area to see if the thing you need is
					listed. If it is, then great, you already achieved your goal. If it is not, no problem, you can ping
					for it and see if you can get it that way. Very quick and very convenient. </p>

				<p> A big way that the app might change in the future, is by expanding the type of items that can be
					borrowed and adding services on top of items. Similarly to lending out a tool, someone could list a
					service they are willing to perform, or look for services, or ping to see if someone can help them
					by providing a service. Money could of course be attached to these services to make them worthwhile.
				</p>
				<p> Kitley might also partner up with certain manufacturing companies to be able to provide a minimum of
					tools that can be rented with pings in certain areas. </p>
